    "text": "With Jack Collins\nOnline, Starting Aug 27, 2024\n\n\nOverview\nDo you ever feel that the data you need for your research is accessible but it’s not in a convenient table, such as company reports or building plans?\nPerhaps the information you need is spread out across many different documents?\nIf only we could read and extract structured data from thousands of written documents.\nIn this course, we explore how to accomplish this task by combining web scraping, Optical Character Recognition (OCR), and Natural Language Processing (NLP). Over four weeks, we provide online lessons and interactive sessions to learn the fundamentals of these key technologies."

The code examples are simple and will run entirely on Google Colab, meaning you will not have to install anything. This course will make a good opportunity to try Python for the first time and you can also try the self-paced BERD introduction to Python course.\n\nWillingness to learn new technical skills\nA Google Account"
